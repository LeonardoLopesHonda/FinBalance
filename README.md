## What is FinBalance?
FinBalance is a website that has the purpose of assisting you on managing your finances through 
registering expenses and providing analytics. 

## How the Website Works

This application is built around the **Kakeibo** savings system, a Japanese budgeting method that helps users manage their finances by categorizing expenses into four main categories:

1. **General**: Essential expenses such as bills and groceries.
2. **Wants**: Non-essential spending like dining out or entertainment.
3. **Culture**: Expenses related to hobbies, education, and cultural activities.
4. **Unexpected Extras**: Unplanned costs or emergencies.

Kakeibo operates on the principle of "envelope budgeting," where each category's budget is treated as if itâ€™s physically separated into different envelopes. As you track your expenses, especially the small ones, the system will give you precise insights into your spending habits.

The key focus of this framework is to help users build better spending habits by:
- Simplifying budgeting
- Tracking all expenses
- Analyzing spending patterns for more informed decision-making

At the end of each month, the app helps you assess your financial behavior and create strategies to reduce unnecessary expenses and save more effectively.

### Key Features:
- Categorize and track all your expenses
- Visualize spending patterns with precise analytics
- Create strategies to optimize your budget at the end of each month
